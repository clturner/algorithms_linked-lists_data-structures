# Linear search in skip list
## Function that searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers
### prototype : skiplist_t *linear_skip(skiplist_t *list, int value);
### Where list is a pointer to the head of the skip list to search in
### A node of the express lane is placed every index which is a multiple
###   of the square root of the size of the list
### And value is the value to search for
### You can assume that list will be sorted in ascending order
### Your function must return a pointer on the first node where value is located
### If value is not present in list or if head is NULL, return NULL
### Every time you compare a value in the list to the value you are searching
###   you have to print this value (see example below)
